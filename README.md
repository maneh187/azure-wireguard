## 🛠️ Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Azure CLI (`brew install azure-cli` or see [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli))
- jq (`brew install jq`)
- curl (usually pre-installed)
- Active Azure subscription with appropriate permissions

**Network Requirements:**
- HTTPS (port 443) access for Azure CLI
- No SSH (port 22) access required - works from any network!

**Cost:**
- Approximately **$15-26 USD/month** (default configuration)
- First 100GB bandwidth free
- Can reduce costs by stopping VM when not in use (`az vm deallocate`)
- See cost breakdown below for details

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Basic Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# Deploy with defaults - interactive region selection
./deploy-wireguard-azure-vm.sh -p "YourSecurePassword123"

# After deployment, access the Web UI to create peers
```

### Specify Region

```bash
# Deploy to specific region (UAE North in this example)
./deploy-wireguard-azure-vm.sh -p "YourPassword" -l "uaenorth"

# Other popular regions: eastus, westeurope, uksouth, southeastasia
```

### Minimal Deployment

```bash
# No Private DNS (simpler, saves $0.50/month)
./deploy-wireguard-azure-vm.sh -p "YourPassword" --no-private-dns
```

### Custom Configuration

```bash
# Specify everything
./deploy-wireguard-azure-vm.sh \
  -p "YourPassword" \
  -s "your-subscription-id" \
  -r "my-vpn-rg" \
  -l "westus2" \
  --ssh-key "/path/to/key.pub"
```

### Advanced: Key Vault (Optional)

```bash
# Store password in Azure Key Vault (requires Key Vault permissions)
# Adds $1/month to costs
./deploy-wireguard-azure-vm.sh -p "YourPassword" --use-key-vault
```

### Cleanup

```bash
# Preview what will be deleted
./scripts/cleanup-wireguard.sh --dry-run

# Delete everything
./scripts/cleanup-wireguard.sh

# Or use deployment script
./deploy-wireguard-azure-vm.sh --teardown
```

## 🔐 Security Notes

**Current setup is suitable for:**
- ✅ Personal VPN usage
- ✅ Testing and development
- ✅ Small team deployments

**For production use, consider:**
- Restrict NSG rules to specific IPs
- Enable Azure Bastion for SSH access
- Implement high availability with multiple VMs
- Add Azure Firewall for traffic inspection
- Enable Network Watcher and logging
- See [DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md) for details

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

| Resource | Monthly Cost | Included by Default |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| VM (B1s) | $10-15 | ✅ |
| Managed Disk (30GB) | $2-3 | ✅ |
| Public IP (Static) | $3-5 | ✅ |
| Private DNS | $0.50 | ✅ |
| Bandwidth (100GB free) | $0-5 | ✅ |
| **TOTAL (default)** | **$15-26** | |
| Key Vault (optional) | $1 | ❌ Use --use-key-vault |

**Save costs:**
- Stop VM when not in use: `az vm deallocate -g rg-wireguard-vpn -n wireguard-vm`
- Skip Private DNS: `--no-private-dns` (saves $0.50/month)
- Don't use Key Vault: default behavior (already excluded)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Can't access Web UI:**
```bash
# Wait 60 seconds after deployment for container startup
curl -I http://<your-ip>:51821

# Check VM is running
az vm show -g rg-wireguard-vpn -n wireguard-vm --query "powerState" -o tsv
```

**VPN not connecting:**
```bash
# Check WireGuard container logs (no SSH required)
az vm run-command invoke -g rg-wireguard-vpn -n wireguard-vm \
  --command-id RunShellScript --scripts 'sudo docker logs wg-easy' \
  --query "value[0].message" -o tsv
```

**Container not running:**
```bash
# Check container status
az vm run-command invoke -g rg-wireguard-vpn -n wireguard-vm \
  --command-id RunShellScript --scripts 'sudo docker ps -a' \
  --query "value[0].message" -o tsv

# Restart container if needed
az vm run-command invoke -g rg-wireguard-vpn -n wireguard-vm \
  --command-id RunShellScript --scripts 'sudo docker restart wg-easy' \
  --query "value[0].message" -o tsv
```

## 🎓 How It Works

1. **Deploy Azure Resources:**
   - Resource group, VNet, NSG, Public IP, VM
   - Private DNS zone (optional) for internal resolution
   - All created via Azure CLI in parallel where possible

2. **Install Docker on VM:**
   - Ubuntu 22.04 with Docker CE 29.0+
   - Installed via `az vm run-command` (no SSH required)
   - Uses Azure's internal infrastructure (HTTPS/443 only)

3. **Deploy wg-easy Container:**
   - Privileged container with NET_ADMIN capability
   - Bcrypt password hashing (wg-easy v14+ requirement)
   - Persistent storage at `$HOME/.wg-easy:/etc/wireguard`
   - Deployed via `az vm run-command`

4. **Manage Peers:**
   - Access Web UI at `http://<ip>:51821`
   - Create unlimited peers with one click
   - Download .conf files or scan QR codes
   - All peer management via browser

**Key Innovation:** No SSH access required for any operation. Everything uses `az vm run-command invoke` which works via Azure's internal routing (HTTPS/443), making it compatible with corporate networks, public WiFi, and firewalls that block SSH.

## 🌐 Universal Network Compatibility

This deployment script works from **any network** - no SSH port required!

✅ Works from:
- Corporate networks with strict firewalls
- Public WiFi (coffee shops, airports, hotels)
- Networks that block SSH (port 22)
- Any location with HTTPS (port 443) access

See [DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md) for technical details on how Azure CLI `run-command` enables this.
